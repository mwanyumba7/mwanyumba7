### Hi there 👋

- 🤖 I'm Brayan Kai, a Data Scientist and Technical Writer. I'm passionate about building impactful solutions and products with Machine Learning. I'm never tired of learning and helping other developers advance their skills. I love writing technical articles on Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence related topics and contributing to open source projects

- 👨🏽‍💻 Currently, I'm working on a project with [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) in patnership with [Learnroll](https://www.learnroll.com/). In this project, we're helping develop a model that can address the issue of implicit biases in healthcare. I collaborate with a cross functional team to help develop an AI model that can accurately help in identifying and mitigating implicit bias for a specific gender bias for patient vignette types in ER scenarios.

- 👥 I'm currently the Technical Writing Channel Lead for [Dev Carrers](https://devcareer.io/) Community. I'm also on the core team for [GDSC Kabarak University](https://gdsc.community.dev/kabarak-university/), leading the Technical Writing track. I also volunteer in the [Open Source Community Africa, Nairobi](https://github.com/OSCA-Nairobi). 

- 🚀 I am very passionate about giving back to the community and sharing the knowledge and experiences I have over time as a Data Scientist.I have given talks & sessions in the following events:
    - DroidCon KE
    - Dev Fest Uyo & Mombasa 
    - I/O Extended events in Nairobi & GDSC Nairobi Edition.
    - Several Google Developer Students Club meetups including; Moi University, Kabarak Univesity & University of Lay Adventist Kigali
