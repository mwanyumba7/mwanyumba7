### Hi there üëã

- ü§ñ I'm Brayan Kai, a Data Scientist and Technical Writer. I'm passionate about building impactful solutions and products with Machine Learning. I'm never tired of learning and helping other developers advance their skills. I love writing technical articles on Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence related topics and contributing to open source projects

- üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Currently, I'm working on a project with [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) in patnership with [Learnroll](https://www.learnroll.com/). In this project, we're helping develop a model that can address the issue of implicit biases in healthcare. I collaborate with a cross functional team to help develop an AI model that can accurately help in identifying and mitigating implicit bias for a specific gender bias for patient vignette types in ER scenarios.

- üë• I'm currently the Technical Writing Channel Lead for [Dev Carrers](https://devcareer.io/) Community. I'm also on the core team for [GDSC Kabarak University](https://gdsc.community.dev/kabarak-university/), leading the Technical Writing track. I also volunteer in the [Open Source Community Africa, Nairobi](https://github.com/OSCA-Nairobi). 

- üöÄ I am very passionate about giving back to the community and sharing the knowledge and experiences I have over time as a Data Scientist.I have given talks & sessions in the following events:
    - DroidCon KE
    - Dev Fest Uyo & Mombasa 
    - I/O Extended events in Nairobi & GDSC Nairobi Edition.
    - Several Google Developer Students Club meetups including; Moi University, Kabarak Univesity, Kibabii University & University of Lay Adventist Kigali

## Recent Work

- [A Gentle Introduction to Neural Networks](https://youtu.be/_L5Kfy0gpWY) In this session hosted by GDSC UNILAK, I covered an introductory session to the atendees about Neural Networks. Covering the essentials explaining the concepts of Neurons, common activation functions  , layers and loss & Optimizer functions. I did a demo on building a simple Neuron Network and each participant was able to build their machine learning model with neural networks.

- [Crowdsource Africa Day Meet-up](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brayan-mwanyumba-309498227_googlecrowdsource-activity-7069036903802503168-LB_S?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) Had a chance to give a talk at the Crowdsorce Africa Day Meet-up. This is a day where as Africans we celebrate our Unity , shared heritage and reaffirm our commitment in building a prosperous Africa. I shared about the Kenyan Coast where I specifically focused on our culture and the history of successes we have had as the coastal region of Kenya. Highlighting our Cultural Diversity and Swahili Heritage, Beautiful beaches and Marine life not forgetting our Historical and Architectural Significance.

- [Machine Learning : Basics and Beyond](https://youtu.be/GzcIodiTCVc) In this session hosted by GDSC UNILAK, I walked the atendees through an intoduction to machine learning. I covered the concept of Rule based aaproach and Machine Learning approach in solving problems. Took the atendees through the Machine Learning Process from Idea to Implementation. Dived deep into the difference between Artificial Inteligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning and the different Machine Learning problems i.e Classification, Regression, Clustering, Sequence Prediction and Style Transfer. 

- [GDG Nairobi Professional Machine Learning Engineer Study Group](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-nairobi-presents-certification-study-group-professional-machine-learning-2023-05-18/cohost-gdg-nairobi) Being one of the facilitators for the Road to Google Developer Certification study group organized by GDG Nairobi. During the week 2 session, I led discussions on ML Problem Framing, which included translating business challenges into ML use cases, defining ML problems, establishing business success criteria, identifying risks, and envisioning future improvements. Furthermore, I guided participants through ML Solution Architecture, where we explored designing reliable and scalable ML solutions, selecting appropriate Google Cloud software and hardware components, and ensuring compliance with regulatory and security requirements. To support their exam preparation, I conducted a thorough review of sample questions for the Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification.

- [Open Source Day Nairobi](https://twitter.com/osca_nairobi/status/1634526519287595009) Led a round table discussion on Open Source Contributions as Practitioners in the Data Field at the Open Source Day Nairobi. Here we discussed common challenges faced when contributing to data projects.We tackled common challenges, ensuring accuracy and quality, effective collaboration, and promoting inclusivity among underrepresented communities in the open sour. It was an engaging exchange of ideas that propelled us towards advancing open source data projects.
