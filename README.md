### Hi there üëã

- ü§ñ I'm Brayan Kai, a Data Scientist and Technical Writer. I'm passionate about building impactful solutions and products with Machine Learning. I'm never tired of learning and helping other developers advance their skills. I love writing technical articles on Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence related topics and contributing to open source projects

- üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Currently, I'm working on a project with [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) in patnership with [Learnroll](https://www.learnroll.com/). In this project, we're helping develop a model that can address the issue of implicit biases in healthcare. I collaborate with a cross functional team to help develop an AI model that can accurately help in identifying and mitigating implicit bias for a specific gender bias for patient vignette types in ER scenarios.

- üë• I'm currently the Technical Writing Channel Lead for [Dev Carrers](https://devcareer.io/) Community. I'm also on the core team for [GDSC Kabarak University](https://gdsc.community.dev/kabarak-university/), leading the Technical Writing track. I also volunteer in the [Open Source Community Africa, Nairobi](https://github.com/OSCA-Nairobi). 

- üöÄ I am very passionate about giving back to the community and sharing the knowledge and experiences I have over time as a Data Scientist.I have given talks & sessions in the following events:
    - CHAOSScon Africa 
    - DroidCon KE
    - Dev Fest Uyo & Mombasa 
    - I/O Extended events in Nairobi & GDSC Nairobi Edition.
    - Several Google Developer Students Club meetups including; Moi University, Kabarak Univesity, Kibabii University & University of Lay Adventist Kigali
    - Space Ya Tech Tech-Talks

## Recent Work

- [Building Trust in AI: The Importance of Explainability in Open Source Projects](https://twitter.com/chaoss_africa/status/1666444906263461888?t=TPglCUOhBmgg7WNpcjH2CA&s=19) I'm this talk which I gave at [CHAOSScon Africa 23](https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2023-africa/) I dived into the critical role of explainability in open source AI and ML Projects and its impact on community health. Sharing how transparency and accountability in open source AI projects can foster trust and collaboration. Empowering the attendees on the importance of building trust in their AI projects through Explainability.  

- [Streamlining Data Analysis with Simple ML for Sheets](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/streamlining-data-analysis-with-simple-ml-for-sheets-tickets-649937258837) In this session hosted by [Space Ya Tech](https://twitter.com/spaceyatech) I talked how you can apply the power of machine learning to your data in Google Sheets in just a few clicks. I explored the following with live demos: Predicting missing Values, Spotting abnormal values, Forecasting Values, Training and understanding a model from your data. Atendees were able to learn how to leverage the add-on, Simple ML For Sheets, on Google Sheets to bring the power of Machine Learning to where there data is. 


- [A Gentle Introduction to Neural Networks](https://youtu.be/_L5Kfy0gpWY) In this session hosted by GDSC UNILAK, I covered an introductory session to the atendees about Neural Networks. Covering the essentials explaining the concepts of Neurons, common activation functions  , layers and loss & Optimizer functions. I did a demo on building a simple Neuron Network and each participant was able to build their machine learning model with neural networks.

- [Crowdsource Africa Day Meet-up](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brayan-mwanyumba-309498227_googlecrowdsource-activity-7069036903802503168-LB_S?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) Had a chance to give a talk at the Crowdsorce Africa Day Meet-up. This is a day where as Africans we celebrate our Unity , shared heritage and reaffirm our commitment in building a prosperous Africa. I shared about the Kenyan Coast where I specifically focused on our culture and the history of successes we have had as the coastal region of Kenya. Highlighting our Cultural Diversity and Swahili Heritage, Beautiful beaches and Marine life not forgetting our Historical and Architectural Significance.

Additionally, participants gained insights into the fundamentals of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its various use cases across industries like healthcare, transportation, and smart cities. Through a hands-on demo session, learners were able to develop machine learning models and deploy them on an IoT device, specifically the Arduino NANO RP2040, thereby gaining practical experience in ML and IoT integration. Furthermore, the workshop emphasized the importance of responsible innovation and ethics in AI, delving into the ethical considerations and potential societal impacts of AI technologies, equipping participants with knowledge and strategies to ensure ethical practices and mitigate any adverse effects. Overall, the workshop aimed to provide a holistic understanding of Machine Learning, Tiny ML, IoT, and ethical considerations, empowering participants with valuable insights into these cutting-edge technologies.
